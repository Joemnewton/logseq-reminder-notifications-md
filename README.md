## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Logseq Markdown/File-based graph** - This plugin works with traditional Logseq file-based graphs only
- If you're using Logseq's Database (DB) version, this plugin will NOT work correctly. Use the DB-compatible version instead.

### Steps

1. **Download this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Joemnewton/logseq-reminder-plugin-md.git
   ```

2. **Load in Logseq:**
   - Settings → Plugins → "Load unpacked plugin"
   - Select the `logseq-reminder-plugin-md` folder
   - Enable the plugin

3. **Grant permissions:**
   - Allow notifications when prompted
   - Check browser notification settings if needed

## Usage

### Supported Formats

**Journal-style timestamps (RECOMMENDED):**
```
SCHEDULED: <2025-10-14 Mon 14:30> Call the dentist
SCHEDULED: <2025-10-15 Tue 09:00> Team meeting
```

**Property-based scheduling:**
```
- Call the dentist
  scheduled:: 2025-10-14 14:30
```

## Troubleshooting

**No notifications?**
1. Check browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Run `/reminders: rescan` to refresh
3. Verify your block uses supported timestamp format:
   - ✅ `SCHEDULED: <2025-10-14 Mon 14:30> Task`
   - ❌ `SCHEDULED: <2025-10-14> Task` (no time)

**Console debugging:**
- Look for `🔔 Reminder Notifications plugin v1.3.0 starting...`
- Check for detailed parsing messages when running rescan
